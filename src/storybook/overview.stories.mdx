# Overview

From [mui.com](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/):

> MUI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design.
>
> It includes a comprehensive collection of prebuilt components that are ready for use in production right out of the box.

`@storybook/mui` consists of a [MUI theme](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/) that styles the MUI standard components according to [Storyblok's design system](https://blok.ink).

Since @storybook/mui is based on MUI, all the [MUI components](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/supported-components/) are available. Some of these components are visualised here in the [MUI Components section](/?path=/story/mui). You'll find the official documentation on https://mui.com/.

`@storybook/mui` also provides some additional components that are unique to this package.
