# Overview

`@storybook/mui` is a component library based on (MUI)[https://mui.com/]. It is the ideal package to use for building Storyblok extensions as it takes care of the task of styling your components and lets you focus on building business logic. Thus, extensions built with `@storybook/mui` will seamlessly, visually integrate into Storyblok.

## What is MUI?

From [mui.com](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/):

> MUI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design.
>
> It includes a comprehensive collection of prebuilt components that are ready for use in production right out of the box.

## What is included?

`@storybook/mui` consists of a [MUI theme](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/) that styles the MUI standard components according to [Storyblok's design system](https://blok.ink). Since @storybook/mui is based on MUI, all the [MUI standard components](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/supported-components/) are available. Some of these components are visualised in the [MUI Components section](/?path=/story/mui). You'll find the official documentation on https://mui.com/.

`@storybook/mui` also provides some additional components that are unique to this package. For example, the `<AppLayout />` component is great for building custom application extensions.
